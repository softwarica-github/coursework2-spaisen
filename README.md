# Install tkinter (Tkinter)
# Note: Tkinter is usually included with Python installations, so a separate installation might not be required.
# If not installed, you may need to install the Tkinter package specific to your operating system.
# For example, on Debian-based systems:
# sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# Install SQLite3 (for database operations)
# Note: SQLite3 is part of the Python standard library, so a separate installation is not needed.

# Install socket (for networking-related tasks)
# Note: The 'socket' module is part of the Python standard library and does not require a separate installation.

# Install subprocess (for executing external commands)
# Note: 'subprocess' is part of the Python standard library and does not require a separate installation.
